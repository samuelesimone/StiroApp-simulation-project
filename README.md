This project was developed for the Simulation course examination taught by Professor Alberto Ceselli during the 
A.Y. 2022/2023, at the University of Milan.

The idea behind this project was to try to validate a startup idea by making use of simulation models. Specifically by leveraging an agent-based simulation.
